Agile Development Processes Project Report
Team 2

Tingting Liu
Kevin Rasku
Florian Stellbrink

This is the project report template.
Fill it out over the course of the project.

# Project Description
Include the project description from the assignment,
your chosen target platform,
programming language,
and a name for the software.

Link to your:

- git repository
- issue tracker
- continuous integration builds

# Sprint 1 Log
Per sprint, fill out one sprint log section and its subsections.

## Commitment
List the features/stories that the team committed to finish during the sprint.

## Work Done
Log what was accomplished, and how.
Please report on all activities; for example, in addition to coding, planning and design discussion.

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
*Name and ID of each feature* | *X hours* | *Member A: Y hours, Member B: Z hours*

## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep within 1000-1500 words.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

Reflect on the agile practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How did the practices interact?
  Did they complement or counteract each other?

- How efficient were the practices, given the time they took to use?


# Sprint X Log
*As for the previous sprints.*


# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.
The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.

Considering the following:

- With regards to the agile practices, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?


# Project outcome
Document the project, for example using screenshots.

\section{Project Description}
SpaceY is a visionary company that launches rocket shaped objects into space. We often have to type in a lot of rocket calculations into spreadsheets which requires us to memorise them. Therefore we are looking for someone to create an app which stores rocketry equations and lets us type in the required values so we can validate the spreadsheets. This should be a very simple application with a strong focus on the UX.

\subsection{Target platform}
A web-application that is primarily used on a desktop but that is also designed to work on mobile devices.

\subsection{Programming language}
Javascript (React) for the frontend, and ASP.NET Core for the backend.

\subsection{Name of the software}
SpaceY Equation App.
\section{Sprint 1 Log}
\subsubsection{Commitment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set up a communication channel
    \item Brainstorming for initial requirements
    \item Initial meeting with customer/coach
    \item Set up git environment
    \item Set up issue tracker
    \item Create initial backlog
    \item Create hello world application
    \item Prepare first report
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Work done}
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|l|l|}
        \textbf{Task} & \textbf{Time estimated} & \textbf{Time spent per member}  \\

        Brainstorming for initial requirements & 30 Mins & 15 Mins per member\\
        Initial meeting with customer/coach & 15 Mins & 10 Mins per member \\
        Set up git environment & 30 Mins & 25 mins per member \\
        Set up issue tracker & 25 Mins & 15 mins per member \\
        Create initial backlog & 20 Mins & 15 Mins per member \\
        Create hello-world application & 20 Mins & 20 mins per member  \\
        Prepare first report & 20 Mins & 15 mins per member \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Work done by each team member during the sprint}

\end{table}


\subsection{Reflections}
For the first meeting, we had a brainstorming session to figure out some of the main requirements of our project. Later, We created a Slack channel for communications, agreed on technologies that are going to be used, set up the report and prepared the environment on Github and related services.\\
Since this sprint was short and focused on getting started, there were no deviations from the sprint commitment.

\subsection{Sprint X Log}
Not available since this is the first sprint.

\subsection{Postmortem}
To be added later.

\subsection{Project outcome}
To be added later.
