\title{Agile Development Processes Project Report\\
Team 2}

\section{Project Description}
SpaceY is a visionary company that launches rocket shaped objects into space. We often have to type in a lot of rocket calculations into spreadsheets which requires us to memorise them. Therefore we are looking for someone to create an app which stores rocketry equations and lets us type in the required values so we can validate the spreadsheets. This should be a very simple application with a strong focus on the UX.

\subsection{Reflections}
For the first meeting, we had a brainstorming session to figure out some of the main requirements of our project. Later, We created a Slack channel for communications, agreed on technologies that are going to be used, set up the report and prepared the environment on github and related services.

Since this sprint was short and focused on getting started, there were no deviations from the sprint commitment.

\subsection{Sprint X Log}
Not available since this is the first sprint.

\subsection{Postmortem}
To be added later.

\subsection{Project outcome}
To be added later.
